**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
To me, the entire topic of search is fascinating. There's so many different aspects to creating an effective search engine and it all has to come together to satisfy a customer/user. If I were to choose, I'd say the semantic search and having these giant embedding models which can somehow turn queries and get meaning beyond keyword search is really interesting. Beyond that, there's potential to train the embedding models further to specialize these models. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
I don't really have a concrete idea of what I'd like to specifically pursue for the Quarter 2 Project, but I think it would be pretty cool to do some sort of work involving graphs for search, and possibly iplementing more personalization like user-specific.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
I think one of the main aspects of my current Quarter 1 Project my partner and I wanted to experience is handling large datasets. It's not often we utilize ~2 million rows of data and it's been really fun. But it has been time consuming trying to write efficient code to reliably run within certain hardware limitations. I feel like we dedicated a lot of time towards that, and makes it harder to test out some things which may be more computationally and time intensive. I don't regret it though, it's all been super fun! One potential change would be to further train an pre-trained embedding model to see if we can squeeze out better results. We do still want to look into n-grams and bigrams. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
Other techniques I'd be interested in using for the current project would be to implement BM25 instead of TF-IDF for the keyword matching portion. If there's time, I'd want to implement some machine learning where the weights for the keyword matching and embedding portions can be tuned to improve the relevancy as well.
